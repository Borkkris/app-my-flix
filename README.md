# myFlix-App

## info
This is my myFlix-App I created as a fellow for CareerFoundry.
It is a “movies” web application. 
The web application will provide users with access to information 
about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, 
update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
